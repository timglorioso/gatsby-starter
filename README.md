# Gatsby Starter

This is an opinionated (yet minimal) starter for Gatsby. It builds off of the official `hello-world` and `default` starters to provide a sensible starting point for any website, based on my experience in starting websites.

## What's Inside?

-   styled components (`gatsby-plugin-styled-components`)
-   SEO component (`gatsby-plugin-react-helmet`)
-   PageLayout wrapper component (`gatsby-plugin-layout`)
-   all the Gatsby image processing goodies (local images can go in `src/assets/images` by default)
-   the best Prettier config ever

That's all!
